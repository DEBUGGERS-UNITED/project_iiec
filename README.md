# project_iiec
Project for IIEC RISE 1.0
The main motive behind this project is to create a terminal user interface(TUI) for RED HAT Enterprise LINUX 8.0(RHEL 8).
A TUI is basically a middle ground between GUI and CLI where we help users to run shell commands from a graphical interface.This makes the life of RHEL users very easy as they dont need to remember lot of commands in order to get their job done.
This project is mainly in Python v.3 .
This project is done under the guidance of Mr. Vimal Daga for IIEC RISE 1.0.
This project was started on 20-03-2020 and is in its initial days of development.
